### Waldstein Phrase Lengths

An experiment with a visualization of musical form using data from the DCML Beethoven Piano Sonatas corpus.
Phrase lengths in relation to phrase onset measure number within the movement: ergo the X axis shows musical time
and the Y axis shows the durations in which musical time is dispensed. The high points in the middle are also the
longest phrases: musical flow is 'choppier' towards the beginning and end.
